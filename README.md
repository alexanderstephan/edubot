# edubot 2019
A robot for use in education. I started the project as a project paper for my school. The acrylic chassis is from watterott.com and has a nice corresponding book from Markus Knapp called 'Building Robots With Arduino'. 
The robot has the basic ability to be controlled manually as well as an obstacle avoidance mode. Everything is controlled via a simple web page which can be accessed by connecting to the ESP8266s local network.

This is my basic concept for schematic so far:
